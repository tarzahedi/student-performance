# Student Performance Prediction

This project analyzes [dataset of student records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression) to predict academic performance based on study habits and lifestyle factors. It explores multiple regression techniques, evaluates model performance, and compares different algorithms.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Multiple Linear Regression modeling  
- Model evaluation with MAE, RMSE, RÂ²  
- Comparison with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and Polynomial Regression

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.  
2. Place the CSV dataset (`Student_Performance.csv`) in the same folder.  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially.  

## Technologies

- Python 3  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn
